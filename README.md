## **Data Analysis for the Hotel Sector - Business Intelligence Project**

<p This project was developed as part of the Master’s in Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. The main objective is to apply Business Intelligence (BI) techniques to analyze data in the hotel sector, starting with an ETL process, followed by dimensional modeling, and concluding with the creation of KPIs and visualizations using Power BI.</p>

<p The central challenge is to transform scattered and unstructured data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making. To achieve this, we worked with internal data and enriched it through web scraping from external sources.</p>
